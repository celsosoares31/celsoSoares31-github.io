# celsoSoares31-github.io
My name is Celso Isabel Soares
I am Currently leaning programming at Universidade Pedagogica de Maputo in Mozambique, so my aim is to use this repository to show up what I will be leaning during my journey in programming. 
I am open to collaborate with those who are willing to help.

The idea of this repository is to build a website where I can show everything I am learning. 

Currently the idea is to focus on HTML and CSS, later I will be introducing some javascript.
